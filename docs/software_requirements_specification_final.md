| NFR25 | The game must not exceed 2GB of RAM usage during normal gameplay |

# Change management plan
As part of my training for this SAS system, I plan on creating documentation online which details the new features and SAS system. This documentation will also include a 'How it Works' section. Additionally, I plan on publishing my research findings and procedures for others to follow into a workshop or conference. 
To ensure integration, I produced a modular approach to the software, allowing the capability of adding a SAS toggle system. I also plan on performing compatibility testing with different hardware and software configurations to ensure the compatibility with different environments.
To help resolve any discovered bugs, I plan on utilizing the GitHub Issues tab on my GitHub project to get notified of any issues. Additionally, I plan on utilizing the logged data to ensure that the software operates as intended during the testing and logging of the SAS/non SAS game.

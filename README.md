# Introverted

This project will consist of creating and testing one method of implementing a de-centralized Self Adapating System (SAS) within the game development environment. The current plan of attack is to have each SAS system control a counteracting goal. To encourage cooperation between these SAS systems, we will introduce a 'Happiness' metric that one of the systems must satisfy based on the state of the other. For simplicity sake, we plan on only implementing two counteracting SAS agents. While similar studies such as this one have been done before, none have previously analyzed the impact that de-centralized SAS systems have within the game environment world.
